You've got a lecture to attend that's starting in a minute. You look around your calendar for the link, then your notion, then the class's website, then ask a friend for help. Class has started, the professor has dropped crucial information, and you've missed it all.

Or maybe you wanna try to submit an assignment. First, you naivgate to the main page. Then look for your class, submissions tab, assignment name, and by the time you're ready to submit you're already exhausted.

I hate needless navigation.

Introducing Jump, a quicklink chrome extension that saves your important links and can be used at a moment's notice. No more searching, no more loading wait times. Reaching the things that matter fast. 

## Getting Started

2. Upload to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) on your computer.
3. Go wild.
